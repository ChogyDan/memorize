To look at the project, start at start.html

If this is your first time, you need to head to the text manager first, then enter your first text.

At this time, the text manager is a bit unclear.  You need to start by entering a title, and then clicking create new text.  Then you can start adding text.

If you are just testing this out, keep in mind that very short texts are not supported.  Try something with maybe 10 lines.
