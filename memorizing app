startup:
command line - list of files with texts to memorize

Goals:
gradually increase difficulty
report progress



brainstorm:
Make requests of users to perform memorizing strategies
 - say stuff out loud
 - forced breaks (pomodoro technique)
 - Just ask if a line is familiar to a person
 - ask for the person to analyze a text, and then use that result to help memorize
 - request stretching and movement breaks

Types of questions:
 - ask if a line is familiar, if yes, next question, if no, show the line with context
 - ask for the line before a given line
 - same, after a given line
 - same, between two lines
