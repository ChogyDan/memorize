Bugs which have been noticed, and need fixing:

When someone memorizes the whole text, and there needs to be a delay, some message should be displayed, instead of possibly crashing.

Maybe refactor   $("#input").keyup(); so that it is more centralized (in texts.html)

TEXTAREA
Improve resizing
- redo using: http://www.impressivewebs.com/textarea-auto-resize/
- maybe above can be extended to width: http://help.dottoro.com/ljalupdo.php
Make sure to handle pasting as well

NEW LINES
need to be scrubbed out at some point from the text, so that they aren't include in the memorization.  Maybe in the strategy object, when the text is first input.
OR, at least new lines need to be displayed correctly in the question area (ie, they need to be converted to <br>s), and also, there shouldn't be more than one newline in the correct answers area

MEMORIZE.HTML
Somehow deal with long gaps
- ignore page reload gaps
- only allow a maximum increase


START.html
When no save is selected, continue doesn't handle this well.  Either prevent continue from being clickable, or just go straight to the text manager page.  Actually, have a <new text> option that just goes to the text manager, KISS.



Sliders: http://jqueryui.com/slider/#colorpicker
- to control difficulty
- to show progress through the whole text

Change setup.sh to open files in order of filename, maybe *.html, then build file list, then open.
